### Work Experience
**Research Collaborator @ University of Milano-Bicocca (_July 2024 - Oct 2024_)
- Development of a georeferenced dataset of Italian healthcare facilities (2010-2021) using National Health Service (SSN) data.
- Address geocoding with OpenStreetMap (OSM) via R and tidygeocoder, resolving mismatches between SSN and OSM addresses through custom R functions.
- Hierarchical georeferencing approach to ensure accurate spatial mapping, integrating multiple validation steps and jittering techniques to prevent overlapping structures.
- Creation of a Marked Point Pattern (PPM) to analyze inequality in healthcare access, classifying hospitals into small, medium, and large facilities based on bed distribution terciles.
- Spatiotemporal analysis of hospital distribution changes (2010-2021) to assess territorial disparities in healthcare accessibility.
- Identification of trends showing a decline in small and medium hospitals, while large hospitals expanded, particularly along the Adriatic coast and in Calabria.
