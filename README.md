## ðŸ“Œ Work Experience
**Research Collaborator @ University of Milano-Bicocca (_July 2024 - Oct 2024_)**
- Development of a georeferenced dataset of Italian healthcare facilities (2010-2021) using National Health Service (SSN) data.
- Creation of a Marked Point Pattern (PPM) to analyze inequality in healthcare access, classifying hospitals into small, medium, and large facilities based on bed distribution terciles.
- Spatiotemporal analysis of hospital distribution changes (2010-2021) to assess territorial disparities in healthcare accessibility.


## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### ðŸ“„ Contributor to the scientific publication: "Analysis and clinical determinants of post-COVID-19 syndrome in the Lombardy region: evidence from a longitudinal cohort study"  
- [BMJ Journals](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/2/e075185)

ðŸ“Ž **Tags:** Censored Data | PCA | Heckit Model
<br>


### ðŸ“„ Churn Analysis: a data-driven approach for improving business performance  
This project focuses on churn prediction in the telecommunications sector using advanced machine learning techniques. These ones were applied to identify key factors influencing contract cancellations. By integrating these models into a cost-benefit framework, the study optimizes retention strategies, enhances customer loyalty, and improves budget allocation. Additionally, customer segmentation and churn motivation classification provide data-driven insights to refine marketing and customer care strategies.

### ðŸ“„ The Impact of Milanâ€™s Area B (Restricted Traffic Zone): Sustainability vs. Mobility Constraints
This study evaluates the environmental impact of 'Area B,' a low-emission zone introduced in Milan in 2019 to reduce air pollution and improve urban air quality. The project conducts a policy evaluation by analyzing the time series of nitrogen dioxide (NOâ‚‚), a major pollutant from road transport, while controlling for meteorological factors such as temperature, precipitation, global radiation, humidity, and wind speed. The analysis follows the Box-Jenkins methodology to model time series dynamics and assess the effectiveness of traffic restrictions implemented over the years. The study aims to determine whether Area B serves as an effective environmental policy or imposes excessive social and economic burdens on residents.
